TENTATIVE GUIDELINES ONTHEPROVISION OFSPEED BREAKERS
FORCONTROL OFVEHICULAR SPEEDS ONMINOR ROADS
1INTRODUCTION
1.1.Development ofsuitable recommendations onspeed
breakers havebeenunder theconsideration oftheTraffic Engineer-
ingCommittee oftheIndian Roads Congress' forsome time. The
Traffic Engineering Committee intheir meeting held atBhopal on
the4thFebruary, 1986entrusted thedrafting oftheStandard based
onthespot studies ofsuitable speed breakers totheUniversity of
Roorkee. The draft prepared bythem wasconsidered bythe
Committee intheir meeting held atHyderabad onthe17thJanu-
ary, 1987and itwasdecided that thedraft could befinalised by
theIRC Secretariat andMember-Secretary, Traffic Engineering
Committee inlight ofthecomments received.
Accordingly, thedrattwasrevised bytheTraffic Engineering
Committee (personnel given below) intheir meeting held atNew

1.2.The revised draft wasconsidered bytheSpecirications&Standards Committee intheir meeting heldonthe9thNovember,
1987. TheCommittee authorised S/Shri J.B.Mathur, D.Sanyal
andK.Arunaehalam tojointly modify thedraft inlight ofthe
comments- oftheSpecifications ScStandards Committee.
1.3.The draft asrevised wasapproved bytheExecutive
Committee intheir meeting held inNewDelhi onthe13thNovem-
ber, 1987. Later on,thedocument wasplaced before theCouncil
intheir 121st meeting held atTrivandrum on6thDecember, 1987.
TheCouncil approved thedocument subject tosome minor changes
which have since been incorporated.
2GENERAL
2.1.Roads ofdifferent categories andunder different situ-
tions aredesigned fordesignated design speeds atwhich vehicles
cantravel withconvenience and safety. However, atcertain loc-
ations, such asapproaches tomanned andunmanned level cros-
sings, sharp curves, congested/accident-prone locations, residential
streets, etc.,control ofspeed maybecome necessary topromote
orderly traffic movement andimproved safety.
2.2.Anumber ofengineering measures areavailable tocon-
trol vehicular speed. Some ofthese areposting ofmandatory
speed limit signs, useofflashing beacons toalert 'drivers, road
markings ofvarious types, etc.
2.3..Yet, there may becases, particularly onsecondary/
tertiary roads andonresidential streets inurban areas, Where cer-
tain- physical constraints maybecome necessary foreffecting con-
trolonvehicular speeds. Inthisregard, three types ofdevices,
namely, speed breakers, rumble strips andwidth restrictions have
been used successfully. Choice among these willdepend onlocal
factors such asthetypeofarea traversed, thetypeandvolume of
traffic, theextent ofspeed reduction desired, andother local fac-
tors. However, speed breakers, inparticular, aremeant mainly
forresidential areas, minor roads, andsimilar situations. Their
useonmajor inter-city roads outside urban areas isnotconsidered
agood engineering practice, andtheIndian Roads Congress does
notfavour it.
2.4. Speed breakers, where permitted tobeinstalled, provi-
devisual, audible and tactile stimuli which. alert drivers andcause
them toslow down. These canhave different heights, lengths,
spacing*, signs, etc. Infact,noparticular design issuitable foral!

thetypes ofvehicles using theroad. Forexample, aspeed breaker
designed fortrucks canbedangerous tomotor cyclists andone
designed formotor cyclists willbeineffective fortrucks. Thedes-
ignrecommended herein isacompromise design tosuitaverage
Indian road traffic conditions and isbased onfield investigations
andresearch.
2.5.Speed breakers arenot.intended assubstitute forpro-
permandatory, warning orinformatory signs butaremeant only
todraw attention ofdrivers toapossible hazard ahead.
2.6. These recommendations may require revision inthe
lightoffuture experience anddevelopment inthefield. Towards
thisend, itissuggested that arecord ofspeed andaccident condi-
tions, before andafter theinstallation ofspeed breakers, should be
kept.
3.DEFINITION
Aspeed breaker isahump surface across theroadway hav-
ingarounded, shape with width greater than thewheel baseof
most ofthevehicles using theroad. When there isdecreased vari-
ation insensory stimuli and atlocations where speed controls are
desired, aspeed breaker acts asastrong stimuli toarouse
reaction inthe brain. Since thedriver reaction times arcfas-
terinresponse toaudible and tactile stimuli than tovisual stimuli,
adriver subconsciously reduces hisspeed. Anideally designed
hump should satisfy thefollowing requirements :
(i)There should benodamage tovehicles norexcessive discomfort to
thedrivers andpassengers when passing atthepreferred crossing
speed.
(ii)Thehump should not give risetoexcessive noise orcause harmful
vibrations iotheadjoining buildings oraffect theother lesidents of
thearea.
(iii)Above thedesign speed, adriver should suffer increasing level ofdis-
comfort (butwithout losing directional control andwithout any vehi-
cledamage) depending ontheextent through which design speed is
exceeded.
4.SCOPE
4.1. Warrants
Useofspeed breakers isjustified primarily under thefollow-
ingthree circumstances :
(1)T-intersections ofminor roads with rural trunk highways, characteri-
sedbyrelatively low traffic volumes ontheminor road butvery high
average operating speed andpoor sight distances. Such locations
have ahighrecord offatal accidents andassuch asperd breaker on
theminor road isrecommended;

IRC :99-1988
(2)Intersections ofminor roads withmajor roads, andmid-block sect-
ions inurban arras where itisdesirable tobrinadown thesoeeds;
and
(3)Selected local streets inresidential areas, school, college oruniver-
sity,campuses, hospitals, etc. Also inareas where traffic isohserved
totravel faster than theregulated orsafesoeed inthearea.
4.2. Other places *here thesemavbettsed include :
(1)Any situation where there isaconsistent record ofaccidents pri
marily attributed tothespeed ofvehicles e.g.when hazardous sec-
tions follow alongtangent approach;
(2)Approaches totemporary diversions;
(3)Approaches toweak ornarrow bridges andculverts requiring speed
restriction lorsafety;
(4)Ontheminor arms ofuncontrolled junctions r?nd atrailway level
crossings;
(5)Sharp curves withpoor sight distances; and
(6)Places ofribbon development, where road passes through built-up
areasandvehicles travelling athighspeeds areasource ofimminent
danger topedestrians.
5.DESIGN OFSPEED BREAKERS
5.1. Speed breakers areformed basically byproviding a
rounded (of17metre radius) hump of3.7metre width and 0.10
metre height forthepreferred advisory crossing speed of25km/h
forgeneral traffic, Fig. 1.Trucks and buses having larger
wheel bases may feel greater inconvenience onpassage atsuch
humps. To facilitate appreciable andcomfortable passage for
larger andheavier vehicles (where their proportion isquite high)
humps may bemodified with 1.5metre longramps (1 :20)ateach
edge. Thisdesign willalsoenable these vehicles topass thehump
atabout 25km/h, Fig. 2.
5.2. Incertain locations speed breakers may have tobe
repeated over asection tokeep speeds lowthroughout. More
humps may beconstructed atregular intervals depending on
desired speed and acceleration/deceleration characteristics of
vehicles. The distance between onehump toanother canvary
from 100to120metres centre tocentre shown inFigs. 3,4and 5.
6.PLACEMENT OPSPEED BREAKERS
6.1.The pattern ofplacement ofspeed breakers depends
upon thelocation and thetypeoftreatment used. Some ofthe
suggested locations have already been indicated inClause 4.AtTintersections speed breakers should beinstalled onminor roads

ofmajor roads. Proper signboards andmarkings arerequired
tobeprovided atsuch locations, Figs. 4and 6.Onsharp
curves, available sight distances guide theplacement andnumber
ofspeed breakers, Fig. 5.Forother situations theEngineer-in-
Charge should usehisingenuity andjudgement.
6.2.Tocheck thetendencies ofdrivers toavoid speed
breakers and using shoulders, itisrecommended thatthespeed
breakers should beextended through theentire width ofshoulder
supported onaproper base,
6.3. Forundivided carriageways speed breakers should
invariably beextended over theentire carriageway width includ-
ingshoulders.
6.4.Onbridges speed breakers should notbeprovided.
However, where frequent accidents have been reported orthe
bridges areoncurves orthey arenarrow, either approach must
havetwospeed breakers each.
7.SPECIFICATION FORSPEED BREAKERS
7.1. Speed breakers arelaidbyfirstmarking thelocation
ofhump onthepavement andmarking indents inthisarea for
proper bonding. Surface isthen cleared ofalldustandloose
particles and atack coat applied. Forms ofrequisite heights,
shape andwidth arethen placed, and hotpremixed bituminous
material ispoured totherequired depth andshape. Forms are
then lifted andthesurface finished torequired shape, andedges
rounded bytrowel. Thepremixed material should bewellcom-
pacted before opening totraffic. Allowance should bemade
forcompaction, and irregularities- should becorrected using
bituminous materials having fineaggregate orbyscrapping, as
necessary. Thematerial isthenallowed tocure before opening
totraffic.
7.2.Arrangements forproper drainage ofthespeed breakers
must bemade toprevent formation ofponds andpuddles.
8.SIGNPOSTING ANDMARKING
8.1. Drivers Should bewarned ofthepresence ofspeed
breakers byposting suitable advance warning signs. Thewarn-
ingsigns, Fig. 6should beofthedesign'HUMP ORROUGH
