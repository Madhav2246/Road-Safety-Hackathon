1INTRODUCTION
1.1 Road signs, which have thebacking oflaw inIndia, areincorporated intheMotor
Vehicles Act,1988.
1.2 TheMotor Vehicles Act, 1988hascovered allthesigns warranted bydifferent traffic
situations. Thedesigns ofsigns arefullydimensioned. Further, thesigns have uniformity, and
mostly symbols areused toconvey themessage, especially inthecase ofregulatory signs.
1.3 TheIRCCode ofPractice forRoad Signs setsoutthemethodology tobefollowed in
theuse,placement, construction andmaintenance oftheroadsigns forallcategories ofroads
including expressways. Theroadsigns adopted inthiscode are inharmony withProtocol on
Road Signs andSignals ofUnited Nations Conference onRoad andMotor Transport, 1949
andVienna Convention onRoad Signs andSignals, 1968.
1.4 TheSecond Revision ofIRCCode ofPractice forRoad Signswasreviewed bythe
Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering andRoad Safety Committee oftheIndian Roads
Congress initsmeeting heldon13thOctober, 2010 based oncomments received from
somemembers and itconstituted aSub-group with ShriNirmal JitSingh astheConvenor
andincluding Shri D.P.Gupta, Dr.(Mrs.) Geetam Tiwari andShriS.B.Basu asmembers to
review thecodeandsuggest modifications/amendments ifanyrequired. TheSub-group after
deliberations further Co-opted Prof. P.K.Sikdar, ShriJacob George and Dr.Surinder Mohan
asco-opted members oftheabove Sub-group considering their richexperience. The entire
Sub-group reviewed thedocument indetail andrestructured itbyrelating sizeandspacing
ofsigns withrespect todesign speed oftheroad, including guidelines forselection ofretro-
reflective sheeting, incorporating somenewsigns andincluding illustrative examples ofsign
plans fordifferent commonly occurring situations. Themodified codewasconsidered by
theTransport Planning, Traffic Engineering andRoad Safety Committee (Personnel given
below) initsmeeting heldon13thSeptember, 2011andapproved forforwarding toIRC for
consideration bytheHighways Specifications andStandards Committee after modifications
based oncomments ofthemembers.

2GENERAL
2,1 Purpose ofRoad Signs
Thepurpose ofroad signs istopromote road safety and efficiency byproviding forthe
orderly movement ofallroad users onallroads inbothurban andnon-urban areas. Road
signs notify road users ofregulations andprovide warning andguidance needed forsafe,
uniform and efficient operation.
2

IRC:67-2012
2.2 Principles ofRoad Signs
ThisCode contains thebasic principles thatgovern thedesign anduseofroad signs for all
categories ofroads including expressways open topublic travel irrespective ofroadagency
having jurisdiction.
Itisimportant thatthese principles begiven primary consideration intheselection and
application ofeach road sign.Tobeeffective, aroad signshould meet fivebasic requirements:
a) Fulfill aneed;
b)Command attention;
c) Convey aclearandsimple meaning;
d)Command respect fromroad users; and
e) Giveadequate time forresponse.
Design, placement, operation, maintenance, and uniformity areaspects thatshould be
carefully considered inorder tomaximize theability ofaroad sign tomeet these fivebasic
requirements.
2.3 Placement andOperation ofRoad Signs
Placement ofroad signs should bewithin road user's view. Toaid inconveying proper
meaning, road signs should bepositioned withrespect tothelocation orsituation towhich
itapplies. Thelocation and legibility oftheroad signshould besuchastoprovide adequate
response time toroadusers toreadandtake action attheoperating speed. Road signs or
theirsupports shall notbearanyadvertising orothermessage that isnotrelated totraffic
control. However, tourist-oriented directional signs andsigns relating tospecific wayside
services andamenities should notbeconsidered asadvertising. Road signs should beplaced
andoperated inauniform andconsistent manner. Road signs which arenotnecessary orno
longer required should beremoved. The factthatasign isingood physical condition should
notbeabasis fordeferring theremoval orchange, ifitissowarranted.
2.4 Maintenance ofRoad Signs
Maintenance ofroad signs should beensured toretain both thelegibility andthe visibility of
thesign. Functional evaluation ofroadsigns should bedone todetermine atregular periodic
intervals, whether certain signs need tobechanged tomeet current traffic conditions. Clean,
legible, properly mounted signs ingood working condition command respect fromroad users.
2.5 Uniformity ofRoad Signs
Uniformity ofsigns simplifies thetask oftheroaduserbecause ithelps inrecognition and
understanding, thereby reducing perception/reaction time. Uniformity assists road users,
traffic police andhighway agencies bygiving everyone thesame interpretation message.
Uniformity alsopromotes efficiency inmanufacture, installation andmaintenance. Uniformity
means treating similar situations inasimilar way.Astandard sign, usedwhere itisnot
appropriate, isasobjectionable asanonstandard sign.
3

IRC:67-2012
2.6 Traffic Engineering Study
Thedecision touseaparticular sign ataparticular location should bemade onthebasis of
traffic engineering study and afteravery careful planning sothatcorrect anduniform signs
areplaced atrequired locations.
Authorities with responsibility for traffic control thatdonothave in-house engineering
assistance cantake helpfrom traffic engineering consultant(s) oracademic andresearch
institutions withdomain expertise.
3CLASSIFICATION OFROAD SIGNS
Road signs areclassified under thefollowing three heads:
3.1 Mandatory/Regulatory Signs
AllMandatory orRegulatory Signs arecircular
inshape. Mandatory/Prohibitory Signs are to
indicate the prohibition upon certain kind of
vehicle maneuver andvehicle type like"overtaking
prohibited" or"U-turn prohibited" or"cycles
prohibited" and restriction onparking like"parking
prohibited" and limitonvehicle speed andsize like
"speed limit"and"maximum load limit" .They are
withredcircular ringanddiagonal bars withblack
symbols orarrows orletters onwhite background.
The red ring indicates prohibitory regulation;
andthediagonal redbarprohibits theaction or
movement indicated bytheblack symbol.
Mandatory signs giving positive instructions are
circular withwhite symbol onabluebackground.
They indicate what driver must docompulsorily.Prohibitory
Regulation
Operational
Control
Compulsory
Direction Control
Forexample, direction control signs are toFi9-3.1
compulsorily regulate certain movements wherever therestriction applies.
Theexceptions inshape aretheoctagonal redSTOP signandthetriangular GIVEWAY or
YIELD sign.These twosigns provide indication about right ofway todrivers.
Mandatory andregulatory signs need tobecomplied withandanyviolation oftherulesand
regulations conveyed bythese signs isalegal offence. Examples ofthese signs areshown
inFig. 3.1.
4

IRC:67-2012
3.2 Cautionary/Warning Signs
Cautionary/Warning signs are triangular in
shape with redborder andblack symbol inwhite
background used tocaution and alert theroad
users topotential danger orexistence ofcertain
hazardous conditions either onoradjacent tothe
roadway sothattheytakethedesired action. These
signs indicate aneed forspecial caution byroad
users andmayrequire areduction inspeed orsome
other manoeuvre. Some examples ofthese signs
areHairpin Bend, Narrow Bridge, Gap inMedian,
School Ahead etc.Anexample isshown inFig. 3.2.Cautionary/

Informatory Signs forfacilities indicates location
anddirection tofacilities like"fuel station" or"eating
place" or"parking" and shallbeasymbol within a
rectangular board withbluebackground.
Information signs inrectangular shape arealso
used with destination names anddistances with
arrows indicating thedirection. Thecolour pattern
ofdirection information sign ispresented in
Table 8.3.These areused togivesuch information
toroadusers which willhelpthem along theroute in
most simple anddirect manner. Examples ofthese
areshown inFig. 3.3.
3.4 Road Classifications
Generally roads areclassified asunder:
a) Expressways
b) National Highways
c) State Highways
d) Major District Roads
e) RuralRoads (Other District Roads (ODR) andVillage Roads (VR))
f) Urban (City)Roads
The direction information signs fordifferent categories ofroad willhave different colour
combinations asgiven inTable 8.3.

IRC:67-2012
4SITING OFSIGNS WITHRESPECT TOTHECARRIAGEWAY
4.1 Theroadsigns arethemeans ofcommunication totheroad users, especially drivers.
Therefore, thesigns shallbesoplaced thatthedrivers canrecognize them easily and intime.
Normally thesigns shallbeplaced onthe lefthand side oftheroad. Fortwolane roads,
normally thesignsmaybeplaced onthe leftside ofthecarriageway, repeated ontheother
side ofthecarriageway, iflocal conditions aresuch thatthesigns might notbeseen intime
bythedrivers. Formultilane divided roads thesignsmaybeplaced onleftside ofeach
carriageway. Incase ofhillroads, thesigns shall generally beinstalled onthevalley side of
theroad, unless traffic androad conditions warrant these tobeplaced onthe hillside.
4.2 On allroads with orwithout kerbandwithorwithout shoulder, theextreme edge of
theground mounted signadjacent totheroadway shallbeatadistance of600mm to3m
from thecarriageway orpaved shoulder edgedepending upon thelocal conditions. Forroads
withkerbs, itshall notbelessthan300mmaway from kerb line,but innocase shallanypart
ofthesigncome intheway ofvehicular traffic.
Gantry mounted signs should bemounted oncolumns preferably 7mormore from the
nearest traffic lane, unless otherwise specified. Theminimum lateral offset isintended to
keep itaway from vehicles thatmayusetheshoulder from striking thegantry column. Ifthere
isasituation where this lateral clearance cannot bemaintained, thecolumn ofgantry sign
shallbeshielded withW-Beam crash barrier forrequired runoutlength depending upon the
setback distance between thepavement edge lineandcolumn ofgantry. Lesser clearances
butnotlessthan 1.8mmaybeusedonconnecting roadways orramps atinterchanges.
4.3 Onkerbed roads, thebottom edge ofthelowest sign shall notbelessthan 2.1m
andnotmore than 2.5mabove thekerb.Onroads without kerb, thebottom edge ofthe
lowest sign shall notbelessthan 2mandnotmore than 2.5mabove thecrown ofthe
pavement. Where signs areerected above footpaths orinareas likely orintended tobeused
bypedestrians, minimum headroom of2.1mistobeprovided.
4A Where intheopinion ofthecompetent authority, asignwould beineffective ifplaced
onthe lefthand sideshoulder ofaroad withdualcarriageway, itmaybeplaced onthemedian
instead. Toimprove thevisibility ofthesigns onmulti-lane roads, theminimum height ofthe
loweredge ofthesignshould bekeptas2.5mabove thehighest point ofthecarriageway.
4.5 Thesigns shall besoplaced thatthese donotobstruct vehicular traffic onthe
carriageway, and ifplaced ontheberm/footpath/refuge island cause least obstruction to
pedestrians. Thedifference inlevelbetween theloweredge ofthesignandthecarriageway
shallbeasuniform aspossible forsigns ofthesame class onthesame route.
M Onmulti-lane roads, thesignsmayhave tobemounted overhead, asthiswould
ensure better visibility andbeeffective incommunicating withthedrivers andother road
users. Overhead signsmaybeused inlieu of,orasanadjunct to,ground signswhere the
6

IRC:67-2012
situation sowarrants forproper information andguidance oftheroad user.Thefollowing
conditions maybeconsidered while deciding about theprovision ofoverhead signs:
• Traffic volume atornearcapacity
• Complex interchange design
• Three ormore lanes ineach direction
• Restricted visibility
• Highspeed traffic
• Insufficient space forground mounted signs
• Large percentage ofcommercial vehicles
• Closely spaced interchanges
4.7 From safety andaesthetic standpoints, overhead signs shallbemounted onoverhead
bridge structures wherever possible. Overhead signs shall provide avertical clearance ofnot
lessthan 5.5movertheentire width ofthepavement andshoulders. Where overhead sign
supports cannot beplaced atasafedistance away from thelineoftraffic orinanotherwise
protected site,theyshould either besodesigned astominimize theimpact forces orprotect
motorists adequately byaphysical barrier orguard railofsuitable design. Encompassing all
above requirements, theplacement ofsigns withrespect tocarriageway withrequired height
andclearance isgiven inTable 4.1andFig. 4.1.
4.8 Mandatory signs (e.g.Keep Left)ontraffic islands arenormally mounted sothatthe
bottom edge isabout 1000mmabove thepaved surface. When several signs have tobe
placed along thesame section ofroad, takecare thattheydonotobscure each other. And
then locate thesigns ataminimum of0.6*V meters apart (where Visthe85thpercentile
speed inkm/h). Signs arenormally erected onthe leftside oftheroad, butforextraemphasis
asecond signmaybeplaced ontheright side oftheroadaswell. This isespecially useful
onleft-hand curves. Wherever minimum lateral clearance cannot bemaintained forgantry
columns fromshoulder edge line,suchexposed column shallbeprotected withcrash barrier.

5ORIENTATION OFSIGNS
5.1 Thesigns unless otherwise stated shall normally beplaced atrightangles tothe
lineoftravel oftheapproaching traffic. Signs relating
toparking, however, should befixed atanangle
(approximately) 15°tothecarriageway soastogive
better visibility.
5.2 Where light reflection from thesign face is
encountered tosuch anextent astoreduce legibility,
thesignshould beturned slightly away from theroadas
shown inFig. 5.1 .Onhorizontal curves, thesignshould
notbefixed normal tothecarriageway buttheangle
ofplacement should bedetermined withregard tothe

6.7.1 Selection ofsheeting
Performance characteristics ofsheeting Type ItoType IXused forroad signs arepresented
respectively inTable 6.3toTable 6.9.The definition ofkeywords inunderstanding the
performance characteristics aregiven below.
"Retro-reflection" means thereflection oflightwhich isreturned indirections close tothe
direction fromwhich itcame, and thisproperty being maintained evenoverwide variations of
thedirection oftheincident radiation.
"Observation angle (symbol a)" istheangle between the illumination axisandthe
observation axisasshown inFig. 6.1.

"Entrance angle (symbol p)"means theangle from theillumination axis tothereference
axis.Thereference axis isanaxisperpendicular totheretro reflective surface asshown in

lx1).Though thesheeting asperASTM classification areavailable fromType ItoType IX,a
"higher" type ofsheeting used intheASTM need notnecessarily imply that itisbetter than
a"lower"-type sheeting, rather itmeets different performance characteristics. Each type of
sheeting hascertain performance characteristics andthetype ofsheeting foraroadshould
beselected which suits thesituation encountered byroad users inviewing thesigns on
theparticular road. Forexample, sheeting with high coefficient ofretro reflection atsmall
observation angle willgivebetter performance fordriver's viewing thesignfrom longdistances.
Similarly, signs withwide observation angle givegood performance fordrivers encountering
situations toobserve thesigns involving wide observation angle. Micro prismatic sheeting is
preferred forgantry mounted overhead signs. Type IVmicro prismatic sheeting maybeused
fordelineator posts.
Table 6.2suggests ageneral guideline forselection ofsheeting considering theperformance
characteristics ofeach type ofsheeting fordifferent category ofroads andalsooneconomic
consideration and visibility requirements inIndian context. However, thechoice forselection
oftype ofsheeting would restwiththeclient.

12MAINTENANCE OFSIGNS
12.1 Prior toinstalling anyroad sign, theresponsibility forthemaintenance ofthesign
andthepost isrequired tobedecided, andthetiming plan(s) should beclearly established.
Over time, signsbecome faded and their retro-reflective properties diminish. Thisreduces
both conspicuity and legibility, bydayandbynight. Excessively discoloured orfaded signs
(e.g. white backgrounds which havebecome grey orbrown, orredborders faded topink)
andsigns, where thelegend orgraphic ispeeling offcannot befully effective andneed to
bereplaced. Thesigns along withtheposts shallbemaintained inproper position, andkept
clean and legible atalltimes. Signs should becleaned atintervals appropriate tothesite
conditions. Signs atlocations where theyaresubject toheavy soiling frompassing traffic, or
algae growth (acommon problem withsigns beneath treecanopies) willneedmore frequent
cleaning.
12.2 Areference number along withthemonth andyear ofinstallation should beplaced
ontheback ofasign inacontrasting colour orbystamping incharacters notexceeding 50
mm inheight. Itisdistracting andunsightly toplace reference numbers onthesignfaceoron
thefront ofabacking board.
12.3 Allsigns shallbeinspected atleast twice ayear both indayandnight times andat
leastonce ayear intherain. Allsigns should bereplaced attheendofthewarranty period
provided fortheretro-reflective sheeting usedonthesign.Damaged signs shallbereplaced
immediately.
12.4 The authorities responsible forroad signs should maintain aschedule ofpainting
oftheposts andsigns periodically. Itisrecommended that painting ofthesigns (where
applicable) maybeundertaken afterevery twoyears. Incase ofoverhead signs, adequate
23

IRC:67-2012
provision istobemade tohaveaccess tothesigns forthepurpose ofmaintenance activities.
Thismust beensured atthetime ofinstallation. Special care shallbetaken toseethat
weeds, shrubbery, mud, etc.arenotallowed toobscure anysign.
13DEFINITION PLATES/SUPPLEMENTARY PLATES
Where thecompetent authority considers itadvisable tomake themeaning ofasign or
symbol more explicit, orinthecase ofmandatory signs tolimit their application tocertain
categories ofroadusers ortospecific periods, aninscription shallbeplaced below thesign in
arectangular definition plate ofsuitable size.The definition plate shallbewith retro-reflective
white background andblack letters andblack border 20mmwide.Numerals shallbeinscribed
ininternational form ofIndian numerals andwordmessages shallbeinEnglish and/or other
languages asnecessary. Tocontain thesize ofthesign, thenumber oflanguages onthe
signs shall normally belimited totwo.Anexample ofdefinition plate isgiven inPlate- II(Fig.
15.42 +Supplementary plate) and itsdesign inPlate III(Fig. 16.17).
14MANDATORY/REGULATORY SIGNS
14=1 Thedetailed dimensioned drawings ofnormal sized signandsymbols thereon are
shown inPlate-I forease ofreproduction. Forsigns ofother sizes, thesymbols should
beproportionately reduced orenlarged. The mandatory/regulatory signs are listed in
Annexure -I.These areclassified under thefollowing sub-heads keeping inview theirdesign
andapplication:
i) "Stop" and"GiveWay" signs (Right ofwaysigns)
ii) "Prohibitory" signs
iii) "NoParking" and"NoStopping" signs
iv) "Speed Limit" and"Vehicle Control" signs
v) "Restriction Ends" sign,and
vi) "Compulsory Direction Control" andother signs
142 Itisessential thatdrivers andother roadusers haveanunobstructed view ofroad
signs. Thedistance which should bekept clear ofobstructions tothesight line,whether
caused byvegetation (e.g.bushes, trees), other signs orstreet furniture (e.g.crash barriers),
isknown astheclear visibility distance. Thehigher theprevailing traffic speeds, thegreater
thisdistance needs tobe.
14.3 Regulatory signs thatindicate thebeginning ofarestriction orprohibition andtowhich
direction itapplies have tobeplaced inaccordance with that direction. Therequirement is
thatthesigns must beplaced oneach side oftheroad oroneach side oftheappropriate
carriageway ofadualcarriageway road; except thatsigns need onlybeplaced ononeside
ifanyofthefollowing circumstances apply:
24

IRC:67-2012
i)Where therestriction, requirement orprohibition applies only tooneside of
theroad.
ii) Atajunction where traffic turns fromaone-way road intotherelevant road.
Thesignshould beangled tofacetowards thedriver.
iii) Atajunction where thecarriageway oftherelevant road islessthan 5m
wideandthecentre ofthesign isnomore than2mfrom theedge ofthe
carriageway.
14.4 Mandatory andregulatory signs arenormally sited atornear thepointwhere the
instruction applies. Table 11.1(Column 4)specifies minimum clear visibility distances for
regulatory andmandatory signs. These should normally bemeasured fromthecenter ofmost
disadvantaged driving lanes. Themore thenumber ofsigns which drivers arepresented with
simultaneously, thegreater thedifficulty theyarelikely tohave inassimilating theinformation.
Generally, notmore thantwosigns should beerected onanyonepostwhen intended to
bereadfromanapproaching vehicle and thisapplies when signs aremounted atthesame
location onseparate posts. Speed limitsigns should bemounted alone.When asignneeds
supplementary plate, thecombination ofsignandplatemayberegarded asonesign.
14.5 STOP Sign
14.5.1 Purpose
This isforindicating priority fortheright ofway.Thesign isintended foruseonroadways
where traffic isrequired tostopbefore entering amajor road,andwhere itisintended thatthe
vehicle shallproceed pastthestop lineonly after ascertaining that this willnotcause danger
totraffic onthemain road. This isaMandatory/Regulatory sign. (Fig. 14.01)
14.5.2 Combination withmarkings
Thestopsign shallalways beused incombination with certain roadmarkings, suchasstop
lineandtheword"STOP" marked onthepavement videIRC:35"Code ofPractice forRoad
Markings".
14.5.3 Size,shape andcolour
Thesign(shown inFig.14.01) shallbeoctagonal inshape and shallhave redbackground
andwhite border. Theword"STOP" written inwhite (inEnglish orlocal language) with

ii)RULES FORDESIGN OFDIRECTION INFORMATION SIGN
The rules fordesign ofdirection information signgiven infollowing subsections shallbe
read inconjunction withthepictorial presentation inPlate IIIand alldirection boards shall
bedesigned accordingly. Itshould benoted thatPlate IIIhasnotbeenshown incolour since
colour pattern fordifferent kindofroads varies andthecolour pattern shallbetaken fromTable 8.3.
1)Alphabets
The"Transport Medium" fontshallbeused forEnglish and"Hindi7" forHindiandforregional
language itshallbeasperlocal practice. Thearrows fordirections boards shall alsobetaken
117

IRC:67-2012
from "Transport Medium" font.Theheight oflettering fordesign ofdirection sign shallbe
taken fromTable 11.1 forthespeed oftheroad inwhich thesign istobeplaced.
2)Common Principles fordesign oflayouts forDirection Signs
Thecommon principles tobeobserved while designing shoulder andgantry mounted
direction signs aregiven inthesubsection below andthespecific principles fordifferent type
ofdirection board aregiven under respective subsections. Thecommon principles fordesign
ofdirection boards (Figs. 16.01 to16.16) are:
Theheight mentioned inTable 11.1 refers totheheight oflower case "x"and
upper case shallbe 1.4times oflower case "x"height.
Thedesign pattern shown inFigs. 16.01 to16.16 expressed thedesign of
layout ofdirection sign interms ofstroke width and "x"height. Stroke width
(s/x) shallbe%oflower case "x"height.
Allplacenames onasign shallbeinletters ofthesame size, regardless
oftherelative importance oftheplace name.Asmaller letter sizemayonly
beused foraname which istoolong tofitintoareasonable sized signand
which cannot behyphenated orabbreviated.
Letters aregenerally placed inanimaginary tileof2times "x"height i.e.8s/w
height andtheplacement ofEnglish lettering ispictorially presented inFig.
16.01 whereas asHindi lettering shallbeplaced within 2times "x"height i.e.
within 8s/wheight.
Related words onthesame lineshallbeseparated byVAs/w.
Route letters androutenumber shallbeseparated by 11/2s/w.

From thediagrams, "C" isthedistance from thesign
where adriver isexpected tostopreading thesign .i.e.
thepointwhere adriver would turn hishead through
10°ormore.
i.e.C=Sxcotangent 10°=Sx5.7
"S" istheoff-set distance from thecentre ofthedriving
lane tothecentre ofthesign. This ismeasured from
thecentre oftheright-hand-most laneonadual
carriageway.
"R" isthedistance travelled while reading thesign.
Distance (R)=Reading Time xSpeed
Reading time=2+(N/3) seconds; where Nisthe
