Since then, there has been development in current day traffic needs, technology, workmanship etc. Therefore, a need was felt to bring out revised version of the Code to include new concepts and materials for laying of road markings with latest technology so as to guide and control traffic on roads. Accordingly, the work of revision of this Code was taken up by the Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee (H-1) during the tenure 2009-2011 under Convenorship of Shri S.C. Sharma. The first draft of revised document was prepared by the Sub-group comprising Dr. Geetam Tiwari (Chairman of Sub Group), Dr. Surinder Mohan, Shri Pawan Kumar Singh, and Shri Amandeep Singh. This draft was discussed in various meetings of H-1 Committee during the tenure 2009-2011."

Choose an area of marking which appears representative of the total area to be assessed. number of readings For continuous lines, take 15 readings over a 5 metre section minimum. If the marking is a centre line, take 15 readings with the equipment facing in each direction. For intermittent lines, take 5 readings per mark for 3 consecutive marks. Note readings should not be taken at the very beginning or end of the line. For markings wider than 150 mm, take readings down the central axis of the line but including some “off-centre” also. Take care to ensure that any such “off-centre” measurements are still made within the confines of the marking. For other markings, such as symbols, letters, transverse marking lines, reading should be taken at 5 approximately equidistant points on the surface of the marking. If a particular reading appears inconsistent another reading, that reading should be taken. s name ● Equipment type and geometry ● Test procedure ● General location ● Length of site ● Location of measurement point ● Date and time of test ● Ambient temperature ● Type and dimensions of markings ● Condition of marking ● Pre-treatment of marking (washed, brushed etc.) ● Weather conditions at time of testing ● Road surface type"

The Project Preparation, Contract Management, Quality Assurance & Public Private Partnership Committee (G-1) felt the necessity to revise this document and accordingly constituted a sub-group under the convenorship of Shri M.P Sharma with Shri Ashok Kumar, Col. A.K. Bhasin, Shri Nirmaljit Singh, Shri A.V. Sinha & Shri P.L. Bongirwar as members to review the Manual. The draft revision was discussed in a number of meetings by G-1 Committee before approving the same in its meeting held on 6 th October, 2018 for placing before the General Specifications & Standards Committee (GSS) for consideration. The GSS Committee in its meeting held on 24th October, 2018 approved this document for placing before the Council for consideration and approval. The Council in its 216th meeting held at Nagpur (Maharashtra) on 22nd November, 2018 approved the draft revision of “Manual of Specifications & Standards for Four Laning of Highways” for printing. The Sub-Group received inputs from Shri Jacob George in drafting Sections on Road Safety and Cross-section drawings which is duly acknowledged."

The Project Preparation, Contract Management, Quality Assurance & Public Private Partnership Committee (G-1) felt the necessity to revise this document and accordingly constituted a sub-group under the convenorship of Shri M.P. Sharma with Shri Ashok Kumar, Col. A.K. Bhasin, Shri Nirmaljit Singh, Shri A.V. Sinha & Shri P.L. Bongirwar as members to review the Manual. The draft revision was discussed in a number of meetings by G-1 Committee before approving the same in its meeting held on 6 th October, 2018 for placing before the General Specifications & Standards Committee (GSS) for consideration. The GSS Committee in its meeting held on 24th October, 2018 approved this document for placing before the Council for consideration and approval. The Council in its 216 th meeting held at Nagpur (Maharashtra) on 22nd November, 2018 approved the draft revision of “Manual of Specifications & Standards for Six Laning of Highways” for printing. The Sub-Group received inputs from Shri Jacob George in drafting Sections on Road Safety and Cross-section drawings which is duly acknowledged."
